# Expense Tracker

A React application for tracking expenses with core functionality.

## Features
- Display expenses in a table
- Add new expenses via form
- Filter expenses by name or category

## Core Deliverables
As a user, I should be able to:

See a table of all my expenses.
Fill out and submit the form to add a new expense. This should display the new expense to the table; no persistence mechanism is needed for this.
Filter expenses by typing into the search bar. Only expenses with a description or expense name matching the search term should be shown in the expenses table.
